"""Turn-based support conversation manager — fraud-aware, evidence-gated, credibility-scored.

The chat is a real multi-turn dialogue that is *deliberately hard to abuse*. The design
rules (from the product owner) are:

1. **Refund is never the default.** Deflection — an exchange or a like-for-like replacement —
   is the first and preferred remedy. A refund is one conditional outcome, reached only when it
   is the eligible remedy AND the claim is verified AND the customer is credible AND it is
   within the automatic caps. Otherwise a human decides. Full refunds are rare by construction.
2. **Rejecting a remedy never buys a better one.** There is no "say no until you get a full
   refund" ladder. Declining the applicable remedy re-affirms it once, then routes to a human —
   it never escalates generosity.
3. **One resolution per session.** Once a remedy has executed or a case has gone to a human, the
   session is locked; it can never move money a second time.
4. **A claim must make sense and be proven.** The issue type must be valid for the product's
   category (no "wrong size" on a television), and money-moving claims (damage, defect, spoiled
   food, wrong item, fit) must be backed by evidence that a vision assessor judges as supporting
   the claim before anything is offered. Weak or contradictory evidence goes to a human.
5. **Credibility is learned and it gates.** A persistent per-customer credibility score tightens
   the gates for customers whose past claims were disproven; it never drops for merely asking, or
   for a genuine claim. It is internal and never shown to the customer.

All monetary proposals still pass through the tested decision core (:mod:`agent.decision`) and
the deterministic guardrails; this layer adds the stricter conversational policy on top.
