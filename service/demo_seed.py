"""Demo-tenant seeding for hosted deployments (opt-in via ``RG_SEED_DEMO=1``).

Free-tier hosts give the app an ephemeral disk, so the SQLite chat/tenant store resets on
every deploy. To keep the public demo self-explanatory, startup (when opted in) ensures a
sample company with an uploaded policy document exists — so anyone opening the live link can
bind a session to "Zomato (demo)" and watch the per-tenant RAG ground the agent's answers.

Idempotent: re-uploading the same doc name replaces it, and an existing company is reused.
Never used in tests (the flag is off by default) and never blocks boot (best-effort).

## Spoiled or contaminated food
If a customer receives food that is spoiled, stale, or contains a foreign object (hair,
insect, plastic), they must report it within 2 hours of delivery with a clear photo. On
verification, Zomato issues a full refund to the original payment source within 24 hours.
No replacement is offered for hygiene incidents.

## Wrong or missing items
If an item is missing or a wrong dish was delivered, the customer may choose a redelivery of
the correct item or a refund of that item's price. A photo of the received order is required.

## Late delivery
Orders delivered more than 20 minutes after the promised time earn a coupon worth 20% of the
order value, capped at Rs 150. No cash refunds for delays.

## Escalation
Any claim above Rs 1000, or a customer with more than 2 refunds in 30 days, must be reviewed
by a support specialist before any payout.

## Damaged, defective or wrong items
A damaged, defective, expired or wrong item must be reported with a clear photo. On
verification, {brand} provides a like-for-like replacement as the first remedy; a refund to
the original payment method applies where a replacement is not possible.

## Change of mind
{brand} offers exchange or store credit for change-of-mind returns inside the return window.
Cash refunds for change of mind are at {brand}'s discretion and require review.

## Escalation
High-value claims and repeat refunders are reviewed by a {brand} support specialist before
any payout.
