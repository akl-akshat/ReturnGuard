"""Fraud-aware chat: turn-based dialogue, evidence gate, credibility, one-resolution lock.

These lock in the behaviour the chat was rebuilt to guarantee — and the fixes that followed the
adversarial red-team:

* refund is never the default, and rejecting a remedy never buys a bigger one (no ladder);
* a claim must be valid for the product category and be proven by SERVER-assessed evidence
  (the customer cannot self-certify it) before money moves; a pivoted claim is re-verified;
* full refunds are rare and human-gated; consequential/high-value defects go to a human;
* a session can only ever produce ONE resolution (no double refunds);
* credibility is persisted and moves ONLY on a human's adjudication of an assessed claim —
  never for merely asking, declining, or being routed to a human procedurally.
